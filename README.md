**Reflection:**      
I decided to make a project based on the Apple website because I believed that I could create the website with the knowledge I already had with HTML and CSS. The difficulty level of the Apple website isn't too easy nor too hard. When I was creating my plan, I didn't know what HTML/CSS code I needed, so I opened up the Apple site and explored the page. Doing this helped me understand what kind of features I needed to implement on my website. During the processes of coding, I realized that creating the website was harder than I expected. To help myself out, I did one part at a time and commented sections for my code. When I was stuck, I asked one of my peers to help me debug my code. For the remix part of the project, I decided to do a continuation of the site. If you scroll down on the Apple website, you will see find more information. Creating the remix version was a lot easier since I was aware of what to include in my code. Throughout this project, I learned to be attentive and to stay on task. Overall, I was able to successfully copy an existing website by using my HTML/CSS knowledge.
